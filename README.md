# fdf

This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french,
hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points
(x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as
a parameter to your program. Here is an example:

Each number corresponds to a point in space:<br />
_•_The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.<br />
_•_The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.<br />
_•_The value corresponds to its altitude.<br />

If you execute your program fdf on this file, we should see something like this:
